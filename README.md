# TalentClass Batch 18 - Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Portfolio

Hi! I'm Romi, a student passionate about tech and currently learning AI & ML.

This repository contains my learning journey through the **TalentClass Batch 18** program, which ran for 8 days via Zoom. It included hands-on projects and theory on Python, machine learning (classification and regression), and a final project.

## 📚 Learning Breakdown

### 🔹 Day 1: Python Basics
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Learned data types, control structures, functions, libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

### 🔹 Days 2-3: Machine Learning - Classification
- Built classification models using logistic regression and decision trees
- Used dataset: `credit-data1.csv`

### 🔹 Days 4-5: Machine Learning - Regression
- Built regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Used dataset: `train.csv`

### 🔹 Days 6-7: Review
- Revisited classification and regression projects

### 🔹 Day 8: Final Project - Housing Price Prediction
- Dataset: `train.csv` (house features and prices)
- Output: `final_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`
- Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

## 🏁 Final Project Highlights

- **Project Title:** Housing Price Prediction  
- **Objective:** Predict house prices using features like area, location, and condition  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Deliverables:** Trained model (`final_model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`)
